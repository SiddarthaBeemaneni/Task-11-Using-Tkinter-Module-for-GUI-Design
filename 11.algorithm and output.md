Aim: To design a simple GUI calculator using Python's Tkinter library that takes two user-input numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, displaying the result.

1. Create the main Tkinter window.

2. Add input fields for two numbers.

3. Create buttons for each operation (+, -, *, /).

4. On button click, read inputs and convert them to float.

5. Perform the selected operation based on which button is pressed.

6. Handle exceptions for invalid inputs and division by zero using error message boxes.

7. Display the result on a label in the window.

Output:

600 + 200 = 800

100 - 97 = 3

50 * 100 = 5000

400 / 5 = 80
